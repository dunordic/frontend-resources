## [Awesome React](https://github.com/enaqx/awesome-react)

Yeah. That might be the only link you need, but that'd make this too short. The **React Tools** portion seems to be a bit dated and certainly not exhaustive. A quick way to see if something is still maintained is to see when the last commit was. If it was months ago it's probably not worth using.

## YouTube

- [Jack Herrington](https://www.youtube.com/c/JackHerrington) _Frontend_
  - Has great content. Half of his videos explore new libraries, half are tips/tricks on using well known ones (like React) better.
- [Dan Abramov](https://www.youtube.com/c/DanAbramov8) _React_
  - A React core team member and the creator of Redux. Focuses on longer-form videos where he builds something from scratch, or with React.
- [Kent C. Dodds](https://www.youtube.com/c/KentCDodds-vids) _React_
  - A pillar of the React community and the creator of [testing library](https://testing-library.com/). He just sarted at [Remix](https://remix.run/), a tool created by a former React core-team member (Michael Jackson) and another pillar of the community (Ryan Florence), so his most recent content is focused there.
- [Vercel](https://www.youtube.com/c/VercelHQ/videos) _Frontend_
  - The creators of [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). Many of their videos are focused on their own open sourced libraries, but nearly all of their open sourced stuff turns heads, so worth checking out.
- [freeCodeCamp's React Course](https://youtu.be/bMknfKXIFA8) _React_
  - A lot of different opportunities to build different small applications with React. A great way to dabble and get some more experience with it
- [Scrimba](https://www.youtube.com/c/Scrimba) _Frontend_
  - Focused on helping people get jobs as Engineers/Developers. A lot of it frontend focused. Doesn't seem to have a ton of content on UI libraries like React, Vue, Svelte, Angular, etc.
- [Ben Awad](https://www.youtube.com/c/BenAwad97) _Frontend (Mostly)_
  - Not specifically frontend focused but has some really good content. I generally agree with his rants, too. Check out his [Practical React](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLN3n1USn4xlntqksY83W3997mmQPrUmqM) course. It' s pretty, pretty, pretty, good.

## Blogs

- [Kent C. Dodds](https://kentcdodds.com/blog)
  - Did I mention that he's a pillar of the community? His blog is pretty good, too.
- [Josh Comeau](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/)
  - Super cool developer. He used to work for [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) which was one of the first Static Site Generator (SSG) frameworks (it's not really used that much anymore). Josh has great content, especially when it comes to styling in React. I'd recommend getting a foundation before checking it out though.
- [Sarah Soueidan](https://www.sarasoueidan.com/blog/)
  - She has some really good content and I consider her a go-to for CSS or accessibility (a11y).
- [Guillermo Rauch](https://rauchg.com/)
  - The founder of [Vercel](https://vercel.com). Although he blogs like once every six months it tends to be prescient when he does.

- [Sarah Drasner](https://twitter.com/sarah_edo)
