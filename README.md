# Frontend Resources

The success I have had in my career has come from standing on the shoulders of giants and I often get asked who I keep up with and how I stay up to date. Mostly it comes from observing; following folks on Twitter; signing up for various newsletters; or stumbling onto a `dependency` in a project that I didn't know about. When I find someone building something cool I find them on Twitter and follow them and, if they have a newsletter, I sign-up. The frontend community is pretty connected, meaning that if you follow one they'll often converse with or promote each other in public (primarily on Twitter) so you can get a lot of exposure just by checking in on folks now and again.

This isn't meant to be exhaustive, obviously. There are tons of great people out there creating awesome tools and contributing that I'm just ignorant of. My hope is that these resources will get you learning and plugged into the community enough where you can start keeping up with trends, learning new tools, and hone your craft.

Could this be an `awesome` list? Sure, I suppose, but I'm not really trying to be awesome, just help, and an `awesome` list implies a go-to reference for any given language, topic, stack, or whatever.

Some folks will be listed multiple times if they have a blog, newsletter, published courses, and are active on Twitter. Be prepared.

## [Awesome React](https://github.com/enaqx/awesome-react)

Yeah. That might be the only link you need, but that'd make this too short. The **React Tools** portion seems to be a bit dated and certainly not exhaustive. A quick way to see if something is still maintained is to see when the last commit was. If it was months ago it's probably not worth using.

## Courses

There's a lot of content out there and some awesome free resources for learning, in my opinion. If you're looking for more depth you'll probably want to sign-up for a paid course. Keep your eyes peeled, most folks will do a discount once or twice a year. You can definitely expect to get a deal around the holidays.

### YouTube

- [Jack Herrington](https://www.youtube.com/c/JackHerrington) _Frontend_
  - Has great content. Half of his videos explore new libraries, half are tips/tricks on using well known ones (like React) better.
- [Dan Abramov](https://www.youtube.com/c/DanAbramov8) _Frontend_
  - A React core team member and the creator of Redux. Focuses on longer-form videos where he builds something from scratch, or with React.
- [Kent C. Dodds](https://www.youtube.com/c/KentCDodds-vids) _React_
  - A pillar of the React community and the creator of [testing library](https://testing-library.com/). He just sarted at [Remix](https://remix.run/), a tool created by a former React core-team member (Michael Jackson) and another pillar of the community (Ryan Florence), so his most recent content is focused there.
- [Vercel](https://www.youtube.com/c/VercelHQ/videos) _Frontend_
  - The creators of [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). Many of their videos are focused on their own open sourced libraries, but nearly all of their open sourced stuff turns heads, so worth checking out.
- [freeCodeCamp's React Course](https://youtu.be/bMknfKXIFA8) _React_
  - A lot of different opportunities to build different small applications with React. A great way to dabble and get some more experience with it
- [Scrimba](https://www.youtube.com/c/Scrimba) _Frontend_
  - Focused on helping people get jobs as Engineers/Developers. A lot of it frontend focused. Doesn't seem to have a ton of content on UI libraries like React, Vue, Svelte, Angular, etc.
- [Ben Awad](https://www.youtube.com/c/BenAwad97) _Frontend (Mostly)_
  - Not specifically frontend focused but has some really good content. I generally agree with his rants, too. Check out his [Practical React](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLN3n1USn4xlntqksY83W3997mmQPrUmqM) course. It' s pretty, pretty, pretty, good.

### Paid

Paid courses or learning platforms for coding can be really expensive. Honestly, I haven't taken any Udemy courses for the Frontend. The last course I really put effort into was on Udemy was a [Golang](https://www.udemy.com/course/go-programming-language/) course I bought 3 years ago. If you find some that seem helpful to you, by all means take 'em. My old bootcamp instructor [Scott Bromander](https://www.udemy.com/course/web-development-concepts-for-everyone/) recently published a course that I would shamelessly endorse.

I'd recommend researching any paid courses you find interesting first and doing what Scott Young (the author of _Ultralearning_) calls [Metalearning](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2013/09/19/metalearning/). That way you can make sure that your money is well-spent. Some of the recommendations below are subscriptions so be aware that you could be signing up for hundreds of dollars a year.

- [Just JavaScript](https://justjavascript.com)
  - A package of content that is meant to help you understand JavaScript better. The first "episode" is free when you provide your email and name, and then the rest of the package has a cost.
- [Epic React](https://epicreact.dev/)
  - A course by Kent C. Dodds that takes you from the basics of React, to advanced stuff. This puppy is _expensive_, but has some really good content. Kent works from the ground-up. I'd recommend considering this when you want to "level-up" your React game.
- [Testing JavaScript](https://testingjavascript.com/)
  - Another course by Kent C. Dodds that focuses on testing. Also not cheap. I recommend taking this once you've learned how to test and are wondering how you might improve your tests.
- [CSS for JS Devs](https://css-for-js.com/)
  - CSS is the thing everyone likes to hate on but, just like most languages and concepts, that often comes from ignorance. Josh does an amazing job of teaching CSS in this course bit by bit. When you're done you'll probably be better at CSS than 60-70% of developers out there.
- [Egghead.io](https://egghead.io/) _subscription_
  - I first discovered Egghead when Dan Abramov published his intro to Redux course on it. There are definitely some good courses on it. It is a little expensive.
- [Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/) _subscription_
  - I may be biased since Frontend Masters (FEM) is based in Minneapolis, but Marc, the CEO of FEM, is awesome and the quality of the content is top notch. That's reflected in the price, though. If you have a learning budget at your workplace definitely ask if you can expense the subscription (and sign-up with your personal email address ðŸ˜‰).
- [Wes Bos](https://wesbos.com/courses)
  - I took his [Advanced React & GraphQL](https://advancedreact.com/) course and thought it was pretty good. He chose to use [Keystone](https://keystonejs.com/) for the CMS for the course, which is a bit of an obscure tool to choose. Don't get me wrong, the class was great and I think Keystone is amazing, it's just not likely to be a tool you'll use at a company; but might be worth reaching for if you go freelance! He's also the cohost of the [Syntax](https://syntax.fm) podcast.
- [Levelup Tutorials](https://leveluptutorials.com/)
  - Scott Tolinski is the other cohost of the [Syntax](https://syntax.fm) podcast, and the creator of Levelup Tutorials. I haven't had the honor of taking any, to be honest, but looking over the catalog it seems like there's a lot of good content there.

## Blogs

I used to voraciously consume blog posts but don't as much anymore. These are the ones I remember looking at pretty often and still check-in on from time to time.

- [Kent C. Dodds](https://kentcdodds.com/blog)
  - Did I mention that he's a pillar of the community? His blog is pretty good, too.
- [Josh Comeau](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/)
  - Super cool developer. He used to work for [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) which was one of the first Static Site Generator (SSG) frameworks (it's not really used that much anymore). Josh has great content, especially when it comes to styling in React. I'd recommend getting a foundation before checking it out though.
- [Sarah Soueidan](https://www.sarasoueidan.com/blog/)
  - She has some really good content and I consider her a go-to for CSS or accessibility (a11y).
- [Guillermo Rauch](https://rauchg.com/)
  - The founder of [Vercel](https://vercel.com). Although he blogs like once every six months it tends to be prescient when he does.
- [Overreacted](https://overreacted.io/)
  - Dan Abramov's blog that explains some of the stuff that appears to be magic in React. Also does some other plain JavaScript writing.
- [Axel Rauschmayer](https://2ality.com/)
  - Super technical but a really helpful resource as you begin to develop a more robust understanding of JavaScript. Often explains some of the forthcoming features to the language, if you want to know the new hotness.
- [Wes Bos](https://wesbos.com/blog)
  - I didn't read Wes' blog as regularly as some of the others for one reason or another. I think because many of the others have a narrower focus, perhaps? Definitely worth checking out.

## Twitter

- [Kent C. Dodds](https://twitter.com/kentcdodds)
  - That guy again.
- [Ryan Florence](https://twitter.com/ryanflorence)
  - One of the creators of [react-router](https://reactrouter.com/) and the co-founders of [remix](https://remix.run)
- [Michael Jackson](https://twitter.com/mjackson)
  - A former core contributor to React. Created [react-router](https://reactrouter.com/) with Ryan Florence. The other co-founder of [remix](https://remix.run)
- [Guillermo Rauch](https://twitter.com/rauchg)
  - Worth keeping up with.
- [Dan Abramov](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov)
  - I refer to him as, "The Dan," because he has this presence, whether he likes it or not, within the JavaScript world that is sorta like the Godfather. I also really like that a lot of his content isn't explicitly React-focused. He includes a lot on vanilla JS, too.
- [Sebastian MarkbÃ¥ge](https://twitter.com/sebmarkbage)
  - A React core contributor.
- [Evan You](https://twitter.com/youyuxi)
  - The creator of [Vue](https://vuejs.org), a popular UI library similar to React, and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) a build tool which will probably end up replacing [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) someday.
- [Sarah Drasner](https://twitter.com/sarah_edo)
  - Is now a director of Web at Google and is one of those people who knows everyone. People she mentions are people to follow.
- [Addy Osmani](https://twitter.com/addyosmani)
  - Now working as an Engineering Manager at Google. Very connected and someone worth knowing.
- [Sara Soueidan](https://twitter.com/SaraSoueidan)
  - Like her blog, great content on accessibility (a11y).
- [Paul Irish](https://twitter.com/paul_irish)
  - A performance engineer at Google.
- [Chris Coyier](https://twitter.com/chriscoyier)
  - The creator of [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com)
- [Sebastian McKenzie](https://twitter.com/sebmck)
  - The creator of Babel.js. Has gone on since to create [ Rome.js ](https://rome.tools/). The rumor (unconfirmed) is that he wrote Babel when he was in his teens.
- [Cassidy Williams](https://twitter.com/cassidoo)
  - Has some great content and a newsletter. She used to work with Ryan Florence consulting on React stuffs.
- [Andrew Clark](https://twitter.com/acdlite)
  - Another React core contributor.
- [Brain Vaughn](https://twitter.com/brian_d_vaughn)
  - ðŸ˜… another React core contributor...
- [Ives van Hoorne](https://twitter.com/CompuIves)
  - The creator of [codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io)
- [Wes Bos](https://twitter.com/wesbos)
  - Have I mentioned him already?
- [Scott Tolinksi](https://twitter.com/stolinski)
  - Also may have mentioned him already...

## Newsletters

- [Cassidy Williams](https://cassidoo.co/newsletter)
  - A weekly newsletter that is pretty short. Often contains a couple of cool libraries that she's found. Often has an interview question to help practice.
- [React Status](https://react.statuscode.com/)
  - Another weekly newsletter that focuses specifically on React.
- [Josh Comeau](https://joshwcomeau.com) _Sign-up at the bottom of the homepage_
  - Let's you know when he's published new content on his site. Also has some newsletter-only content he creates.
- [CSS Weekly](https://css-weekly.com/)
  - CSS get knocked a lot by everyone but is much more powerful that most people realize and not keeping up with it risks puting you in a position where you're still using `float` to position content, or harming the accessibility of a website. Do yourself a favor and play with it every now and then like you might with JavaScript.
